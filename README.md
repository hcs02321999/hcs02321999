Hello World;
My name is Hunter Stevens, I graduated in 2023 from the University of Mount Olive where I played baseball for 4 years while earning a Masters and Bachelors.
I continued to play baseball professionally for about a year and a half after graduating.
Now I am learning and practicing to be a professional in data analytics, I practice and study everyday to refine my skills.
